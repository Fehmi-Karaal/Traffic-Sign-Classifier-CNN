# Traffic Sign Classification Using CNNs

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of traffic signs. The model is trained to recognize various traffic signs such as stop signs, speed limit signs, crosswalk signs, and traffic lights.

## Project Structure

The project includes Jupyter notebooks that detail the model training and evaluation process, as well as Python scripts for a simple API to perform predictions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train the model.
4. Use the Flask API script to start making predictions.

## Important Warning About File Paths

Before you run any of the code in this repository, please ensure that you have updated the file paths in the scripts and notebooks to match your local environment or Google Colab workspace. Absolute paths are used in the code, which may not directly correspond to the structure in your system.

For example, if you see a path like `/content/drive/My Drive/Techcareer_AI_Bootcamp/...`, you will need to replace it with the correct path where your files are located.

Failure to update the file paths will result in errors such as `FileNotFoundError` or `OSError`, and the code will not execute as intended. Double-check all paths before attempting to run any scripts.
