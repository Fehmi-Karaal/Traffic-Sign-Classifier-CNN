# Traffic Sign Classification Using CNNs

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of traffic signs. The model is trained to recognize various traffic signs such as stop signs, speed limit signs, crosswalk signs, and traffic lights.

## Project Structure

The project includes Jupyter notebooks that detail the model training and evaluation process, as well as Python scripts for a simple API to perform predictions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train the model.
4. Use the Flask API script to start making predictions.

## Important Warning About File Paths

Before you run any of the code in this repository, please ensure that you have updated the file paths in the scripts and notebooks to match your local environment or Google Colab workspace. Absolute paths are used in the code, which may not directly correspond to the structure in your system.

For example, if you see a path like `/content/drive/My Drive/Techcareer_AI_Bootcamp/...`, you will need to replace it with the correct path where your files are located.

Failure to update the file paths will result in errors such as `FileNotFoundError` or `OSError`, and the code will not execute as intended. Double-check all paths before attempting to run any scripts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the traffic sign classification model is available on Google Drive. You can access it using the following link:

[Traffic Sign Classification Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HQTqJAS6OMmqW9A83hQb9rznrGBF6HXl?usp=sharing)

### Instructions for Using the Dataset:

1. **Accessing the Data**: Click on the link above to view and download the dataset files.

2. **Download the Data**: You can download the entire folder or specific files. If you are using Google Colab, you can mount your Google Drive and access the files directly in your notebooks.

3. **Data Structure**: The dataset is organized into different folders, each representing a category of traffic signs such as 'stop', 'speedlimit', 'crosswalk', and 'trafficlight'. Make sure to maintain this structure when you use the data for training the model.

4. **Updating File Paths**: When using the dataset in the provided code or Jupyter notebooks, make sure to update the file paths according to where you have stored the dataset on your local machine or Google Drive.

### Important Note:

If you encounter any issues with accessing or using the dataset, please verify that you have the necessary permissions to view and download the files from Google Drive. If the link is not accessible, or you need additional assistance, feel free to reach out to the repository maintainer.
