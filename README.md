# Traffic Sign Classification Using CNNs

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of traffic signs. The model is trained to recognize various traffic signs such as stop signs, speed limit signs, crosswalk signs, and traffic lights.

## Project Structure

The project includes Jupyter notebooks that detail the model training and evaluation process, as well as Python scripts for a simple API to perform predictions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to train the model.
4. Use the Flask API script to start making predictions.

## Contributing
